# What do we want to do?
Ultimate goals of the project and what each feature should look like should be outlined here. 

# What else do we need?
For the features above, what is left for each one? Test coverage? Bug squash? Etc...


# 1. Get a Django project started
- First point of order is to get a django project scaffolded out using their built in project tools. 
- Determine infra/system design choices (which DB do we want etc)


# 2. Implement Single elimination tournament generator
- Single Elim is the first thing people think of (usually) for a tournament so that is the first format we will implemenmt
- How many teams (how do we handle odd numbers)? How do we ingest scores (simple win/loss)? Even the simple bit of ending the tournament etc.
